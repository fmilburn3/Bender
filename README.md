Bender e14 Files

The files within contain partial documentation of a project posted here: https://www.element14.com/community/community/project14/cheerusup/blog/2021/04/12/make-robot-friend-bender

It is provided for those interested in the project design.  It is a moderately complicated project and I am not offering further assistance on printing or construction. Smaller 3D printers may not be capable of printing the larger parts.  Parts may need rotation to print without supports and some parts contain tight tolerances.  Additional brackets for batteries, microcontrollers, etc. may be needed.
